# Trackgenix landing page

Web page of trackgenix, a software to manage projects.
Designate the roles of super admins, admins, project managers, and employees to track the hours worked on a project.

## Week 1:
Working in groups we built the landing page prototype in figma.

## Week 2:
Made the HTML code for the landing page and uploaded the progress to GitHub.

## Week 3:
With CSS I applied the styles to the elements of the landing page and rearranged their position.

## Week 4:
Made the content responsive by using flexbox to arrange the elements in the page. Also separated the code in different files depending on the sections of code they affect.
Activated the pages section on GitHub to be able to view the page online.

## Week 5:
Instead of working on the page we learned about Javascript. The task was to solve exercises about variables, control sentences, loops and functions.
