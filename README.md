# Trackgenix landing page

Web page of trackgenix, a software to manage projects.
Designate the roles of super admins, admins, project managers, and employees to track the hours worked on a project.

## Week 1:
Working in groups we built the landing page prototype in figma.

## Week 2:
Made the HTML code for the landing page and uploaded the progress to GitHub.

## Week 3:
With CSS I applied the styles to the elements of the landing page and rearranged their position.

## Week 4:
Made the content responsive by using flexbox to arrange the elements in the page. Also separated the code in different files depending on the sections of code they affect.
Activated the pages section on GitHub to be able to view the page online.

## Week 5:
Instead of working on the page we learned about Javascript. The task was to solve exercises about variables, control sentences, loops and functions. 
[Here](https://johsua30.github.io/BaSP-M2022-Etapa-1/semana-05/) is the link to the index.html file with the solved exercises linked. To see the solutions right click on the background, select Inspect and open the Console.

## Week 6:
The task was to create the log in and sign up using the styles from the landing page and make them show the errors or the success of the action with javascript. All the validation is done with javascript. Also the landing page, the log in and sign up will link to each other.

## Week 7:
I worked on the files of the previous week adding an HTTP request if all the fields in the form are valid. The objective is to send the data to a server and if all data is correct save locally the contents of the request. The content saved locally has to autocomplete the fields on other visits of the page.
